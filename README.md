# Chat App

Chat App With many Features ( Send, Seen, Profile, And Video Calling With WebRTC )

using flutter SDK and Node.js

#### A note about video calling
Right now, I don't have a stun server, so video connectivity won't work unless the two ends of the connection are on the same network (WIFI)
